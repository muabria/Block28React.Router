Overview
What We're Building

Our goal in the workshop is to build a simple application which navigates between two routes /blue and /red. 

Each will render a simple component with the background being that specific color. 
 
1 Initialize Project + React Router Configuration 
    - install npm create vite@latest -- React and JavaScript 
    - Follow prompts and npm install in the desired folder. 
    - Remove the boilerplate in the App.jsx and npm run dev, replace CSS + App.jsx code with what is given in workshop (that'll be our reference and startup)
    - Install npm install react-router-dom 
    - make sure you import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
    - nest the BrowserRouter tag with the React Strict mode component.
    - Create Home.jsx, mainSection.jsx, navBar.jsx, and footer.jsx files 
    - 
    

2 NavBar + MainSection 
    - Create a navBar file 
    - Import your Link from React Router 'import { Link } from "react-router-dom";'
    - Create Two or more Route components one "/blue", "/red", and "/orange"
    -
