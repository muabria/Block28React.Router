Overview
What We're Building

Our goal in the workshop is to build a simple application which navigates between two routes /blue and /red. 

Each will render a simple component with the background being that specific color. 
 
1 Initialize Project + React Router Configuration 

    a. install npm create vite@latest -- React and JavaScript 

    b. Follow prompts and npm install in the desired folder. 

    c. Remove the boilerplate in the App.jsx and npm run dev, replace CSS + App.jsx code with what is given in workshop 
    
    (that'll be our reference and startup)

    d. Install npm install react-router-dom 

    e. make sure you import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

    f. nest the BrowserRouter tag with the React Strict mode component.

    g. Create Home.jsx, mainSection.jsx, navBar.jsx, and footer.jsx files 
    h.  
    

2 NavBar + MainSection 

    a. Create a navBar file 

    b.  Import your Link from React Router 'import { Link } from "react-router-dom";'

    c.  Create Two or more Route components one "/blue", "/red", and "/orange"
